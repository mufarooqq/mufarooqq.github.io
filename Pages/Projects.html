<h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>The following lists few of the projects, research or otherwise, that I've worked on. I'll keep updating the list by time.</p>

        <h4><a name="fyp">Automatic Tomato Sorting through Image Processing</a></h4>
        <p>This project is a part of my Bachelor's thesis. It involved the implementation of some image processing and machine learning algorithms based on a research paper to sort tomatoes on the basis of their physical attributes, which is a great initiative for the fruit industries
		considering the growing needs of quality. Currently, I am working on the same project to implement some more related algorithms and compare their performances. I plan on publishing the paper to some journal after I finish with the research work.

   <div class="archive_post_text">

        <h4><a name="mas1">A 3x3 FPGA Overlay Architecture</a></h4>
        <p>A course project in Master's degree program that involved the use of VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) to implement an FPGA overlay architecture. This 3x3 FPGA had 9 Configurable Logic
Blocks (CLBs) and a full adder was mapped on 2 of the logic blocks. Generally, it could map any logic
on its K-LUTs; where K could be 1-4.

        <h4><a name="mas1">A Statistical model for prediction of ODI stats of a cricket player</a></h4>
        <p>A course project in Master's degree program that implements some statistical methods on 3/4th of the given ODI data of a cricket player to predict the runs, centuries, ducks and other stats for the remaining 1/4th of the data. The data for this project was obtained from some online websites that provide detailed cricket statistics. The project hasn't yet completed, but upon completion, I plan on publishing a paper on it.

        <h4><a name="mas1">Implementation of some Networking concepts in
NS-3</a></h4>
        <p>A course project in Master's degree program that involved the use of most common network simulation software, NS-3 on
a Linux distribution to simulate transmission of packets over the network. The first part of the project transmitted packets from one node to another using a routing node in the network. The second part involved the implementation of a packet transmission system in which random Poisson data traffic was generated using OnOffApplication specified in the
NS-3. This traffic was then used to simulate queue paramters using a Tracer file.

   <div class="archive_post_text">

        <h4><a name="mas1">Network Traffic Classification using Machine
Learning and Weka</a></h4>
        <p>Traffic classification is of fundamental importance
to model the network behavior. A classified traffic information is
essential to understand how resources in the Internet are being
used to effectively control the services that receive this traffic.
The traffic classification and identification is vital to the areas of
network management, network planning and QoS provision. This
course project involved a traffic classification scheme based on machine
learning (ML) algorithms. A ML software, WEKA (Waikato
Environment for Knowledge Analysis), is utilized to perform
this experimentation which contains all the implementations of
these algorithms.

   <div class="archive_post_text">

        <h4><a name="mas1">Image Compression using Haar Wavelet Transform
and Run-Length Encoding</a></h4>
        <p>The Wavelets are a powerful set of tools to deal
with different scientific and engineering problems, including,
but not limited to the signal compression or de-noising, image
enhancement, compression or de-noising. This implementation
focuses on the compression of images using the famous Haar
Wavelet Transform, which is relatively simpler of all the other
2-D Wavelet transforms. The selected image is also quantized
and Run-Lenth Encoding (RLE), which is a lossless data
compression technique, is also applied on the image.

   <div class="archive_post_text">

        <h4><a name="mas1">Wavelet Feature Selection for Image Classification</a></h4>
        <p>Feature selection is the process of
automatically selecting a subset of most relevant attributes in
the given data. A real life data may contain a large number of
features or variables that are redundant or irrelevant. Feature
selection technique is used to efficiently extract only the useful
and relevant set of features from this huge data.
There are different transformation methods such as
Independent component analysis, Principal Component
Analysis etc. Wavelet feature extraction is also one of the
techniques used to extract the most relevant features in a set
of data. This course project involved the re-implementation of a paper that uses Wavelet Packet Transform to perform
the feature extraction using two novel algorithms, Mutual information
based sub band selection (MISS) and Sub band Grouping and
Selection (SGS).

        <h4><a name="mas1">Descriptive Statistics Final Project</a></h4>
        <p>This is the final Project for the Descriptive Statistics course at Udacity. This project is done by conducting an experiment dealing with drawing from a deck of playing cards and then creating a writeup containing my findings. A Matlab code is written to perform this experiment.

   <div class="archive_post_text">

        <h4><a name="mas1">Color based Object Tracking</a></h4>
        <p>The project focuses on implementation of the object detection
and tracking system based on its color. The input to the project is
the video/image data which is continuously captured with the help of a webcam interfaced
to the laptop. The high level vision control system uses serial communication to direct the low level mechanical
parts. So, if the object is detected, the servo motor attached to the camera is rotated in such a way that wherever the object
moves, the camera points to that object.
